# Neurova - GitHub and PyPI Publishing Guide

This guide walks you through publishing Neurova to GitHub and PyPI. Everything is ready to go.

## What's Been Prepared

Your package now has professional structure following GitHub best practices:

**Community Files**:

- CONTRIBUTING.md - How to contribute
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md - Community standards
- SECURITY.md - Security reporting
- CHANGELOG.md - Version history
- SUPPORT.md - Getting help
- README.md - Professional overview

**GitHub Templates** (.github/):

- Bug report template
- Feature request template
- Question template
- Pull request template
- CI workflow (testing)
- Publish workflow (PyPI automation)

**Package Files**:

- pyproject.toml - Package metadata
- setup.py - Build configuration
- LICENSE - MIT License
- MANIFEST.in - Package includes

## Step 1: Push to GitHub

### Create the Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/nalystresearch
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name it: `neurova`
4. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Push Your Code

```bash
cd /Users/harrythapa/Desktop/Neurova

# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial release v0.1.0

- Complete computer vision toolkit
- GPU acceleration support
- Deep learning capabilities
- Comprehensive documentation"

# Set main branch
git branch -M main

# Add remote (replace with your actual URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/nalystresearch/neurova.git

# Push
git push -u origin main
```

### Verify on GitHub

After pushing, check that:

- All files appear on GitHub
- README displays correctly
- Links in README work
- Community tab shows all health files

## Step 2: Publish to PyPI

### Option A: Test PyPI First (Recommended)

This lets you test the package without affecting the real PyPI.

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
cd /Users/harrythapa/Desktop/Neurova
source .venv/bin/activate

# Create account on Test PyPI: https://test.pypi.org/account/register/

# Upload to Test PyPI
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
# Enter your Test PyPI credentials when prompted

# Test installation
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps neurova

# Try importing
python -c "import neurova; print(neurova.__version__)"
```

### Option B: Publish to Production PyPI

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Create account on PyPI: https://pypi.org/account/register/

# Upload to PyPI
twine upload dist/*
# Enter your PyPI credentials when prompted
```

### After Publishing

1. Visit https://pypi.org/project/neurova/
2. Verify the page looks correct
3. Test installation: `pip install neurova`

## Step 3: Set Up Automated Publishing (Optional)

This lets GitHub automatically publish to PyPI when you create releases.

### Get PyPI API Token

1. Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/
2. Click "Add API token"
3. Name it: "GitHub Actions - Neurova"
4. Scope: "Project: neurova"
5. Copy the token (starts with `pypi-`)

### Add to GitHub Secrets

1. Go to https://github.com/nalystresearch/neurova/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Name: `PYPI_API_TOKEN`
4. Value: Paste your token
5. Click "Add secret"

### Create a Release

Now when you want to publish a new version:

1. Update version in neurova/version.py
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Commit and push changes
4. Go to https://github.com/nalystresearch/neurova/releases
5. Click "Create a new release"
6. Tag: `v0.1.0` (or your version)
7. Title: "Release v0.1.0"
8. Description: Copy from CHANGELOG.md
9. Click "Publish release"

GitHub Actions will automatically:

- Run tests
- Build package
- Publish to PyPI

## Step 4: Verify Everything Works

### On GitHub

- [ ] Repository created
- [ ] All files pushed
- [ ] README displays correctly
- [ ] Links work
- [ ] Community tab shows health files
- [ ] CI workflow runs (if you pushed)

### On PyPI

- [ ] Package appears at https://pypi.org/project/neurova/
- [ ] Description displays correctly
- [ ] Links work
- [ ] Can install: `pip install neurova`
- [ ] Can import: `import neurova`

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Git push fails

**Solution**: Make sure you created the repository on GitHub first and used the correct URL.

### Issue: Twine upload fails with 403

**Solution**:

- Verify your PyPI credentials
- For first upload, you may need to use username/password instead of API token
- Make sure the package name isn't already taken

### Issue: Package name already exists on PyPI

**Solution**:

- Choose a different name
- Update `name` in pyproject.toml
- Rebuild: `rm -rf dist/ && python -m build`
- Try uploading again

### Issue: README doesn't display on PyPI

**Solution**:

- Make sure README.md is in Markdown format
- Check for syntax errors
- Rebuild package
